PhD student in Computational Biology at [CMU–Pitt CPCB](https://www.cmu.edu/compbio/) · [Koes Lab](https://bits.csb.pitt.edu/)

I work on improving the synthesizability of molecules generated by deep generative models for drug discovery. 
I aim to create tools that advance research, contribute to open-source software, and help drive progress in personalized medicine.
